# A70 Overlay

Magisk module uses Dynamic Installer and should only flashed in Magisk

## Enable

I was bored, so I created some funny/cringe stuff

All changes needs reboot

```bash
# Cringe Settings
su -c "setprop persist.overlay.dg.settigns.cringe true"

# Cringe WhatsApp (I've warn you)

su -c "setprop persist.overlay.dg.whatsapp.cringe true"
```

## Supported Spoofs

**REMOVED!** There is no more target brand/device. Read _Enable_ above

## Generate overlay

**REMOVED**

## Build?

```bash
# run
cd build
bash build.sh --versionName 17 --versionCode 170
# or
bash build.sh -n 17 -c 170
```

> You don't know how to do that? Then don't do it.
